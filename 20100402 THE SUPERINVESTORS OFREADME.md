THE SUPERINVESTORS OF

GRAHAM-AND-DODDSVILLE

by Warren E. Buffett

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article is an edited transcript of a talk given at Columbia University in 1984 commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Security Analysis, written by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. This specialized volume first introduced the ideas later popularized in The Intelligent Investor. Buffett's essay offers a fascinating study of how Graham's disciples have used Graham's value investing approach to realize phenomenal success in the stock market.

If you have a high-speed internet connection, you may prefer to read this version of the speech (a 1.6 MB .pdf file), which has all of the tables.

Note: the tables Buffett mentions are in The Intelligent Investor, but are not reproduced here. The Sequoia and Munger records are published here.

 
Is the Graham and Dodd "look for values with a significant margin of safety relative to prices" approach to security analysis out of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today say yes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock prices reflect everything that is known about a company's prospects and about the state of the economy. There are no undervalued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart security analysts who utilize all available information to ensure unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the market year after year are just lucky. "If prices fully reflect available information, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out," writes one of today's textbook authors.

Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors who have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at least worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that these winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as superior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fifteen years ago. Absent this condition - that is, if I had just recently searched among thousands of records to select a few names for you this morning -- I would advise you to stop reading right here. I should add that all of these records have been audited. And I should further add that I have known many of those who have invested with these managers, and the checks received by those participants over the years have matched the stated records.

Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let's assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on "How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning." Worse yet, they'll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, " If it can't be done, why are there 215 of us?"

By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same - 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips.

I would argue, however, that there are some important differences in the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a) you had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the U.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if (c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you would be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would probably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he's feeding them, whether they had special exercises, what books they read, and who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraordinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might be causal factors.

Scientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were trying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer -- with, say, 1,500 cases a year in the United States -- and you found that 400 of them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you would get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of those afflicted, or other variables. You know it's not random chance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily know the causal factors, but you would know where to search.

I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other than geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be what I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a disproportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment world came from a very small intellectual village that could be called Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particular intellectual village.

Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-flipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he called heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same way. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that 100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing. You would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Similarly, let's assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society and every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten members. Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so strong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day, every member of the family identified with the father's call. Now, at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and you would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor as an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it would have no significance at all because it would simply mean that you didn't have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 randomly distributed families who were winners.

In this group of successful investors that I want to consider, there has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But the children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have called their "flips" in very different ways. They have gone to different places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet they have had a combined record that simply cannot be explained by the fact that they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the calls for them to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual theory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has decided on his own manner of applying the theory.

The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without the efficient market theorist's concern as to whether the stocks are bought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July, etc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses, which is just what our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the purchase of marketable stocks -- I doubt that many are cranking into their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in which the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn't make any difference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a Friday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time and effort to see whether it makes a difference when buying small pieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors, needless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model, or covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of any interest to them. In fact, most of them would have difficulty defining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables: price and value.

I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of price and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine buying an entire business simply because the price of the business had been marked up substantially last week and the week before? Of course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and volume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are almost endless data available about them. It isn't necessarily because such studies have any utility; it's simply that the data are there and academicians have [worked] hard to learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

I think the group that we have identified by a common intellectual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic studies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, seasonality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual concentration of value-oriented winners.

I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of us who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954 through 1956. There were only four -- I have not selected these names from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-Newman for nothing after I took Ben Graham's class, but he turned me down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously! After much pestering he finally hired me. There were three partners and four of us as the "peasant" level. All four left between 1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it's possible to trace the record of three.

The first example (see Table 1) is that of Walter Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben Graham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left Graham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here over 28 years. Here is what "Adam Smith" -- after I told him about Walter -- wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):

He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that's about it.

In introducing me to (Schloss) Warren had also, to my mind, described himself. "He never forgets that he is handling other people's money, and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss." He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him and stocks are real -- and from this flows an attraction to the "margin of safety" principle.

Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at considerably less than their value to a private owner. And that's all he does. He doesn't worry about whether it it's January, he doesn't worry about whether it's Monday, he doesn't worry about whether it's an election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks than I do -- and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the business; I don't seem to have very much influence on Walter. That's one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.

The second case is Tom Knapp, who also worked at Graham-Newman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before the war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum. And then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a night course in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit basis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School, where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd's course again, and took Ben Graham's course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom to ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the beach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!

In 1968, Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple, along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed Tweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear in Table 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversification. They occasionally bought control of businesses, but the record of the passive investments is equal to the record of the control investments.

Table 3 describes the third member of the group who formed Buffett Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in 1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a continuation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single index I can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment management at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it has been satisfactory.

Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed by a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham's class, Bill Ruane. After getting out of Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business education so he came up to take Ben's course at Columbia, where we met in early 1951. Bill's record from 1951 to 1970, working with relatively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound up Buffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle all our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a terrible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier market and all the difficulties that made for comparative performance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that my partners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but added money, with the happy result shown here.

There's no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I recommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if he achieved a four-point-per-annum advantage over the Standard & Poor's, that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved well over that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That makes things much more difficult. Size is the anchor of performance. There is no question about it. It doesn't mean you can't do better than average when you get larger, but the margin shrinks. And if you ever get so you're managing two trillion dollars, and that happens to be the amount of the total equity valuation in the economy, don't think that you'll do better than average!

I should add that in the records we've looked at so far, throughout this whole period there was practically no duplication in these portfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepancies between price and value, but they make their selections very differently. Walter's largest holdings have been such stalwarts as Hudson Pulp & Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New York Trap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly to mind to even a casual reader of the business pages. Tweedy Browne's selections have sunk even well below that level in terms of name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big companies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very low. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty people yelling out the same thing after him.

Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960 and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better. He set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter's. His portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown. Incidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner for a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he ran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost completely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned earlier.

Table 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie Munger's -- another non-business school type -- who was a math major at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and was an IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to him. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965 to 1983, against a compounded gain of 316 percent for the S&P, came off with 22,200 percent, which probably because he lacks a business school education, he regards as statistically significant.

One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buying dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately to people or it doesn't take at all. It's like an inoculation. If it doesn't grab a person right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show him records, and it doesn't make any difference. They just don't seem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick Guerin, who had no formal education in business, understands immediately the value approach to investing and he's applying it five minutes later. I've never seen anyone who became a gradual convert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn't seem to be a matter of IQ or academic training. It's instant recognition, or it is nothing.

Table 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts major at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the advertising agency of Bozell & Jacobs. We happened to be in the same building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better business than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes for Stan to embrace the value approach.

Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not own what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently. But every time Perlmeter buys a stock it's because he's getting more for his money than he's paying. That's the only thing he's thinking about. He's not looking at quarterly earnings projections, he's not looking at next year's earnings, he's not thinking about what day of the week it is, he doesn't care what investment research from any place says, he's not interested in price momentum, volume, or anything. He's simply asking: what is the business worth?

Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I've been involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with which I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influenced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented managers. Very, very few pension funds are managed from a value standpoint. Table 8 is the Washington Post Company's Pension Fund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.

As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at least 25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not have been necessarily the choice of these managers. So I've included the bond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no particular expertise about bonds. They wouldn't have said they did. Even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was not their game, they were in the top percentile of fund management. The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly long period but it does represent many investment decisions by three managers who were not identified retroactively.

Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don't manage a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to select value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected managers much the same way as most larger companies. They now rank number one in the Becker survey of pension funds for their size over the period of time subsequent to this "conversion" to the value approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any duration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative record better than the S&P. The net difference now between a median performance and the actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243 million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the selection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I would necessarily select but they have the common denominators of selecting securities based on value.

So these are nine records of "coin-flippers" from Graham-and-Doddsville. I haven't selected them with hindsight from among thousands. It's not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of lottery winners -- people I had never heard of before they won the lottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework for investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect, character, and temperament. It's very important to understand that this group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record in years when the general market was weak. While they differ greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole businesses. Far more often they simply buy small pieces of businesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a business, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the difference between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.

I'm convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market. These Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully exploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stock can be influenced by a "herd" on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently nonsensical.

I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward. Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If someone were to say to me, "I have here a six-shooter and I have slipped one cartridge into it. Why don't you just spin it and pull it once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million." I would decline -- perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer me $5 million to pull the trigger twice -- now that would be a positive correlation between risk and reward!

The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dollar bill for 60 cents, it's riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case. The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less risk there is.

One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was selling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than $400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the Post, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets. Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who would have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.

Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made the valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would have been greater. And to people that think beta measures risk, the cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it's riskier to buy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 million. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities and you know anything at all about business valuation, there is essentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particularly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles of $8 million each. Since you don't have your hands on the $400 million, you want to be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people, but that's not a difficult job.

You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses. But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by having a margin of safety. You don't try and buy businesses worth $83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous margin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000 pound trucks across it. And that same principle works in investing.

In conclusion, some of the more commercially minded among you may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many converts to the value approach will perforce narrow the spreads between price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wrote Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing in the 35 years that I've practiced it. There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult. The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It's likely to continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.

我用了两天，尝试把＜The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville＞翻译出来。

因为，我觉得这篇文章实在是太好了。
它不但是对 Graham 最大的颂赞，
还显示出了 Buffett 的清晰思路和有条不紊的逻辑辩证。

由于文章很长，我分开几个贴来发表。

编者按：
1984年，为了纪念由Benjamin Graham和Daved L. Dodd所合著的《Security Analysis》出版五十周年，哥伦比亚大学邀请了巴菲特来主办一场演讲。这篇文章，“The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville”，乃是根据当时的讲稿改编而成。文中，巴菲特告诉我们，Graham的追随者们如何运用Graham的价值投资法，在股市中取得非凡的成功。

（因此，文中的第一人称“我”，指的是巴菲特。）

也许有人会问：Graham和Dodd所提倡的价值投资法，是不是已经过时了呢？
今天，很多学术人员会回答说：是的。他们认为，市场是有效的，所以，一切有关经济状况和公司的前景的因素都会反映在股票的价格中。这是因为股市中有很多聪明的分析员，他们会尽量应用所有已知的资讯，使得股票不会偏离其合理的价格。支持此理论的人认为，股市中是没有所谓的“被低估”的股票的；而那些所谓“能够战胜市场”的投资者，也只不过是侥幸罢了。因为，根据其理论（价格已反映所有资讯），拥有“长期战胜市场”的能力，是不可能的。

无论如何，以下我将为大家介绍一批投资者。他们年复一年的，取得了比S&P500指数更好的投资成果。那么，他们的成功到底是不是纯粹的巧合或运气呢，这是值得我们来验证一下的。首先一点，所有以下例举的这些成功者都是我所认识的人，而且都是早在15年前或更久以前，就已经被认定为是优秀的投资者了的。这一点非常重要。因为，如果说，我是在今天早上才从几千个名单中选出最成功的那几个来给你们，那以下的内容就没有什么意义了。第二点，所有的这些投资记录都是经过审查的（audited）。而且，我曾向有参与这些基金的人们求证，他们这些年来所取得的回酬，证实是与这些基金的财政报告相符的。

在我们开始这项验证之前，先说一个比喻。大家想象一下，现在我们举办一个全国性的“掷硬币”赌博游戏，让全体美国人（2.25亿）一起参加，每个人的都以1美元的赌注开始玩。第一天早上，所有的参与者将会开始押注。猜对了的人，可以赢得猜错的人的那1美元。每一天，输了的人会被淘汰出局。第二天，留下来的胜利者将继续游戏，但都必须把之前所赢来的钱全拿来做赌注。如此，（根据“掷硬币”50%的胜负几率）每过一天，就会有约一半的人出局，赌注也会翻一倍。过了十天，则会有大约22万的人可以连续猜中了十次，他们每个人也会赢得了约1000美元多一点。

这时候，这一班人，可能就会开始有点飘飘然了。他们也许会故作谦虚，同时也很可能会开始向异性们炫耀自己的本事，以及在“掷硬币”游戏中的超凡见识。

假设这一批胜利者们继续玩这个游戏。那么，再过十天，我们就会有215位优胜者。他们连续的猜中了20次的硬币，而且在整个过程中，从1美元的赌注翻倍到了1百万美元。

这时，他们开始被胜利冲昏头脑了。他们也许会开始出书，书名叫《我如何在20天内，用1美元赚取1百万》，并开始做全国性巡回演讲，教导人们猜硬币的技巧。对于那些对他们的能力有所怀疑的学者，他们会挑战说：“如果不是因为我们懂得技巧，怎么会有这么多个（215）成功的例子？”

这时，有些学者可能就会不客气地说话了：“就算我们找2.25亿只猴子来玩同样的游戏，也会得到一样的结果：将有215只猴子可以取得连续20次的胜利。”

无论如何，我接下来要介绍的成功例子呢，会和上述情况有所不同。想象一下，如果：(a)你根据与美国人口分布同样的比例，从全国各地找来了2.25亿只猴子；(b)在经过了20天的游戏后，有215只胜利者；(c)你发现在这些胜利者当中，竟然有40只猴子是来自于同一个小镇的同一间动物园。这时，你可能就会开始到这动物园作采访了，问问管理员是喂什么食物给它们吃、它们有没有受过什么特别训练、读过什么书，等等等。也就是说，当你发现到有许多的成功者很不寻常的集中在一起时，你会开始寻找看有没有其他特征也集中在同一个地方，因为那可能就是导致成功的因素。

科学上的研究，通常也是遵循着这种模式的。比如说，你想要分析某种罕见疾病的成因。如果你发现，全国仅有的1500宗病例中，有400宗是发生在同一个小镇的。那么你可能就会开始研究那里的水质、居民的工作性质、或其它的各种因素等等。因为你知道，有400宗病例集中在这么小的范围，一定不是纯粹的巧合。虽然你仍不知道疾病成因，但你知道应该到哪里去寻找。

我要说的是，这世界上的人，除了可以用地理发源地来进行划分以外，也可以用“知识来源”作为把他们分类。如果你在“投资世界”里做个统计，你就会发现，有极高比例的成功者，都是起源自一个叫做Graham-and-Doddsville的知识小村庄。投资成功者在这个小村庄中的所显示出的高度集中趋势，并不能单纯的用巧合、运气来解释。

当然，在一些特别的情况下，这种集中趋势可能没有什么重要意义。例如，可能有个很有领袖魅力的人，拥有着100个死硬派的支持者。在“掷硬币”游戏中，每次这个领袖开始押注时，所有的这些支持者都会不假思索的跟着押同样的注。那么，如果刚巧这个领袖成为了最后的那215位胜利者之一，我们就会有看到很高的成功例子集中在这个100人集团的“知识小村”中。但它其实是没有什么意义的。因为，你只能够把这100个成功例子当作1个来计算。

同样的，如果我们假设整个美国是由许许多多“酋长式”的家庭所组成的，每个家庭都有10个成员。当全国2.25亿的人民开始玩这个“掷硬币”游戏时，每个家庭中的成员，都会毫不犹豫的跟着他们的父亲下押同样的注。那么，20天的游戏结束后，你会发现215个胜利者只集中在21.5个家庭。有10位成功者来自同一家庭，难道这就表示说这些家庭成员真的拥有“猜硬币”的技能吗？当然不是。因为在这种情况下，我们有的不是215个胜利者，而是21.5个随机的胜利家庭罢了。所以，这种集中趋势也是没有意义的。

对于我所要介绍的这一批投资者们，我觉得可以把他们看作是来自于同一个“知识家庭”，而他们的家长，就是Graham。但是，这些孩子们已经离开了这个家庭，并各自以不同的方式来“猜硬币”。他们分散到了不同的地方，各自买卖不同的股票；而他们共同达到的成功，是不能够单纯以随机的巧合来解释的。我们也不能够说，他们是因为遵随着一个领袖的指令，而做出相同的押注的。他们的大家长只不过是制定了一套“猜硬币”的知识理论，这批学生们呢，则是按照各自的方式，应用那套理论去做出各自的判断的。

这些来自“Graham-and-Doddsville村”的投资者们所拥有的知识共同点是：他们都在寻找生意（公司）的价值和其价格之间的差异，并从中获利。当他们做出决定要买入某个股票时，他们是从不关心那一天是星期几，或是哪一个月份（这是那些“市场有效”的理论家们所关心的）。无独有偶，当一个生意人要买入一项生意时，他也是不太可能会去关心那项买卖到底是在星期几、或哪一个月份进行的。（Graham-and-Dodd的投资者们所做的事其实是与这些生意人一样的，只不过，他们是通过股票市场来买入一项生意罢了）。既然买入某个生意是不需要考虑到是星期几或哪个月份的，我真感到怀疑，为什么有那么多学者仍然花费大量时间和精力在这一方面的研究呢。我们的这批Grahan-and-Dodd的投资者们，当然也不会去关心一些诸如beta、capital asset pricing model、covariance in return等等的参数。事实上，他们中的大多数，可能连这些东西是什么都不知道。他们只关心两个数字：价格和价值。

我一直都感到奇怪，为什么会有那么多有关价格与成交量关系、以及各种图表的研究。难道你会因为某个公司的价格刚刚于上一星期被调高了，就冒然的买入它吗？今天，之所以会有如此多有关价格与成交量等参数的研究，那是因为在这电脑时代，我们可以很容易取得这许多的资讯。这些研究不见得要有什么价值，只不过是因为我们有了那么多资料，而学者们也已花了相当多的努力在学习有关的数学知识。即使那些资料是没有应用价值的，但当人们具有了相关技能时，好像不去用它就是有罪似的。就如我一个朋友所说的：对于一个手握槌子的人来说，所有的东西看起来都像是钉子。

我觉得，我所介绍的这一群来自同一知识家庭的投资者们，更值得大家去研究。奇怪的是，虽然这群价值型投资者身上已显示出那么高的成功比例，目前似乎仍没有学者有兴趣对他们的投资方法进行研究。

The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville



在我向他介绍了Walter过后，＂Adam Smith＂在《Supermoney》（1972年）中，写了一篇有关Walter的报导。以下，是这篇文章中对Walter的评论：

He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that’s about it.

In introducing me to Schloss, Warrren had also, to my mind, described himself. “He never forgets that he is handling other people’s money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss.” He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him and stocks are real—and from this flows and attraction to the “margin of safety” principle.

Walter采取完全的分散投资策略，目前持有着百多只股票。他知道如何去寻找那些以低于其价值的价格出售的股票。而这就是他所做的全部事情。他从来不担心那天是不是星期一，或者是不是一月份，又或者是不是大选的年份。他只是单纯的说，“如果我能够以40sen的价格买入一项价值为1元的生意，肯定有好事情会发生”。他持有的股票数量比我多出许多，且他似乎没有兴趣知道所买入的公司是从事什么生意的。也就是说，我本人对他全没有任何影响力。这就是他的优点，他几乎完全不受任何人的影响。


第二个例子是Tom Knapp，是我在Graham-Newman公司的工作伙伴。在二战前，他曾在普林斯顿主修化学系。参战回来后，他成了沙滩的无业游民。有一天，他得知Dave Dodd在哥伦比亚开办一项有关投资的夜间课程。他报读了那项课程后，发现自己对投资产生了极大的兴趣。于是，他申请进入哥伦比亚商学院，并在那里取得MBA学位。其间，他有修读了Dodd和Graham开办的课程。35年后的今天，当我要向他求证以下的资料时，我又在海边见到了他。所不同的是，今天他已是沙滩的主人了。

在1968年，Tom Knapp和Ed Adnerson（另一个Graham的学生），和几个拥有相同投资信念的伙伴，一起开创了Tweedy, Browne Partners公司。Table-2中列出了他们这些年来的投资成绩。他们是通过非常分散的投资策略来达到的这些成果的。他们偶尔会买入一间公司的大量股份，以掌握公司的控制权。但，在他们没有控制性股份的公司，他们所得到的投资回酬并不亚于他们所掌控的公司。

Table-3是第三个成员的投资成绩，他在1957年成立了Buffett Partnership公司。在1969年过后，他解散了公司。虽然从那以后，他仍通过Berkshire Hathaway继续他的投资事业，但是我找不到一个很好的标准参数来表达Bershire的投资成果。不过我认为，不管从是从哪一方面来衡量，它的成绩都是相当令人满意的。

The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville

Table-4是Sequoia Fund的投资记录。这个基金的管理者，Bill Ruane是我于1951年在Graham的投资课里认识的。毕业于哈佛商学院，到华尔街工作后，他觉得自己仍然需要多学习一些有关商业方面的知识，于是就在1951年到哥伦比亚大学选修了Graham的课程；我们就是在那时候认识的。在1951至1970年期间，他管理一个规模较小的基金，成果比起行业平均成绩远来得的好。当1969年我要结束Buffett Partnership时，我请他设立一个新的基金，来帮忙继续管理我的伙伴们的资金，这就是Sequoia Fund的由来。这个基金并不是在一个很好的投资时机设立的，当时我正要抽离股市呢。接下来几年，股市的调整给他的投资表现带来的艰巨的挑战。值得高兴的是，我的伙伴们不但没有离弃他，还不断的增加投资额。结果，大家都得到了满意的回报。

The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville

这些，并不是“事后诸葛亮”的评论。Bill是我推荐给我的伙伴们的唯一人选。当时我说过，如果他能够取得比S&P500高4%的年回酬率，就已经是很好了。Bill的不只越了预期的成绩，其基金的规模还一直在膨胀。毋庸置疑的，资金规模会成为投资表现的负累。当资金不断成长时，并非说你不能取得比平均成绩更好的回酬，但它的难度会增加。当你管理着一个2兆元的基金，而这规模刚好就是整个经济体系里的资金数量，你就不再可能取得优于平均的回酬率了。

 

我必须强调的是，我举的例子中，它们的操作中从来没有出现过相同的投资组合。虽然他们都是在寻找证券的价格和价值的差异，他们各自的决策是很不一样的。Walter所持有最多的股票，都是诸如Hudson Pulp & Paper，Jeddo Highland Coal，NewYork Trap Rock Company等等；都是些只要稍微有留意财经版的读者都不会感到陌生的名字。Tweedy, Browne所选的股票呢，大都是一些名不见经传的小公司，大家可能连它们的名称都没听过。Bill则钟情投资于一些大型公司。这些投资组合中，出现重叠的股票是非常非常之少的。这些投资记录，并不是一个人做了决策后，再让50个人来模仿他的。

Table-6是Rick Guerin的投资记录。他是Charlie Munger的一个朋友，毕业于USC数学系（又一个不是商学院出身的例子），曾进入IBM从事销售工作。当我找到Charlie后，Charlie找到了他。从1965到1983年，相对于S&P指数的316%回酬，他取得了约22,200%的总回酬。

The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville

这里要补充一点：说起来也奇怪，人们对于“以40sen购买价值$1的资产”这个概念，不是一点就通，就是完全拒绝。如果一个人一开始就不接受这个概念，即使你跟谈论好几年，并拿出投资记录给他看，他的想法还是不会改变的。他们就是没有办法接受。像Rick Guerin的例子，他没有受过任何商学院的教育，却能够马上明白这个概念，并在5分钟内就开始运用它了。我从来没有看过有一个人是经过十年时间才慢慢转变成价值型投资者的。它与个人的IQ或教育背景没有关系。它要不然就是马上被领悟，不然就是永远都不明白。

Table-7是Stan Perlmeter的记录。他是密之根大学的文科生，毕业后成了Bozell & Jacobs广告代理的一个事业伙伴。我们曾在Omaha的一个建筑物内相遇。1965年，他发现我的生意比他的还赚钱，就离开了他的广告代理事业。同样的，Stan只用了5分钟，就接受了价值投资法。

The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville

Perlmeter并没有持有的与Walter或Bill相同的股票。他的投资成果是靠他自己的独立判断来达到的。不过呢，相同的是，每当Perlmeter决定要购买一个股票时，是因为他知道，他所得到的价值，比他所付出的价格更高。这就是他唯一所关心的。他不去看公司的季度盈利预测，他也不看公司明年的盈利；他不管那一天是星期几，也不看任何人的研究报告；他对股票的价格动量、成交量、等等完全不感兴趣。他只问一个问题：这生意值多少钱？

Table-8和Table-9是我有参与的两个退休基金的投资记录。我曾经对其发挥过影响力的，就仅仅只有这两个基金；它们并非是我从几十个基金中挑选出来的。在我的引导下，这两个基金都转向成了由价值型的经理来管理。其它的退休基金，很少有跟从价值型投资法的。Table-8是华盛顿邮报的退休基金。好几年前，它是由一家大银行来管理的。后来我建议说，如果他们挑选一些价值型的经理来管理基金，他们将可取得不错的成绩。





The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville

如你所见，他们的总体成绩一直以来都在同行中取得极高的排名。华盛顿邮报公司要求这些经理们至少保留25%的资金在债券投资中。我在Table-8中也列出了他们在债券投资方面的成绩，是为了让大家知道，他们在债券方面并不在行。他们本身也是这么认为的。即使受到了这25%（投资于他们所不熟悉的债券）的拖累，他们的投资成绩仍然在基金管理方面名列前茅。虽然这个基金的记录所涵盖的期限不是很长，但它代表了三个基金经理的许多投资决定。这三个人，并不是事后才挑选出来的。

Table-9是FMC Corporation的退休基金。我从来没有亲自管理过这个基金，但曾在1974年影响了他们的决定，挑选价值型的基金经理来管理它。在那之前，他们挑选基金经理的方式与其它大公司没有什么不同。今天，由于那次“转型”，在Becker一项关于退休基金的调查中，它已是规模最大的基金了。去年，他们共有8位基金经理；其中的7位的累计回酬比S&P的表现还好，全部8人在去年都取得了比S&P还好的回酬。在这段时间内，FMC基金的总回酬比其它基金的平均表现总共多出了2.43亿美元。FMC把这项成就归功于他们在挑选基金经理时的信念。那些经理不一定都是我会挑选的，但他们都有个共同点：根据价值来选择所投资的股票。

The <wbr>Superinvestors <wbr>of <wbr>Graham-and-Doddsville

好了，以上这些，就是来自Graham-and-Doddsville的九个投资记录。我并不是在事后才从几千个人当中选出这九个人来的。这个情况有异于我以一些彩票中奖者名单（那些在他们中奖之前，我从来没听过的名字）来吸引你。我是在很久以前，就已经根据他们的投资原则，挑选出了他们。我除了知道他们曾经学习过什么，也对他们的智慧、人格和脾性有相当的了解。还有很重要的一点是，他们的投资，风险都是比别人低得多的。只要看一看他们在大市下跌时的投资表现就可以知道这一点。虽然，他们每个人的投资风格很不一样，但在思想上有共通点：他们都是在购买生意，而不是买股票。他们当中有些人，有时候会买下整个生意，其它大多数情况下，他们只是买下某个生意的小部分；不论是哪一种情况，他们所持的态度是一样的。他们有的持有几十只股票，有的则集中投资在几家公司；任何情况下，他们都是根据一间公司的内在价值与其市价之间的差异来投资获利的。

我可以很肯定的说，市场中存在着许多非有效性。这些Graham-and-Doddsville投资者们一直以来都是从价格与价值之间的差异谋利的。当一个股票的价格受到华尔街“羊群”影响，而被人们的情绪、贪念和恐惧把推向极端时，我们很难相信，它的价格变化是理性的。事实上，股票的市价往往是不合理的。

我还想说一个重点，是关于风险与回酬的关系的。有时候，风险与回酬是成正比的。如果有一个人对我说：“我这里有一枝可以装六发子弹的手枪，但我只装了一颗子弹在里面。你可以把它旋转一下，然后对着自己开一枪。如果你没死，我会给你1百万。”我会拒绝他，也许还跟他说，1百万不值得我这么做。然后呢，他可能给我另一个选择：“你对自己开两枪，如果不死，可得5百万。”这种情况，就是所谓的回酬越大、风险越大了。

在进行“价值型”投资的时候，情况刚好相反。如果你以60sen买入某个价值为1元的股票，比起你用40sen买入它，风险会更大。但是，后者的预期回酬却是比较大的。在价值投资中，潜在回酬越大，则风险越低。
举一个简单的例子。华盛顿邮报在1973年时，市价是8千万元。可当时，你可以轻易的以4亿元的价格把它的资产卖给任何买家。这家公司除了拥有Post、 Newsweek等报纸业务，还控制了几家强大的电视台。这些资产现在至少值20亿元；可见，以2亿元买下它的人并不是笨蛋。

现在，如果它的股价继续下跌，使得它的市价只剩4千万，则它的beta值就会增加。对于那些认为beta值是衡量风险的重要指标的人来说，更便宜的价格会使得这项股票变得更具风险。这真是奇妙。我从来都不明白，为什么以4千万来购买一个价值4亿元的资产，风险会比用8千万购买来的高。当然，由于你并非亲自去管理这4亿元资产，你必须确保它的管理者是个诚实、有能力的人，这并不是一项很难办到的事。

你必须具有一些知识，才能让你有能力去评估某个生意的真实价值。但你也不能太过信任这个估值。这就是Graham所说的margin of Safety。例如，不要以$80million去购买一个价值$83million的企业。但你必须留有余地。当你建造一座可以承受3万磅压力的桥梁时，你只会让自己驾驶一辆不超过1万磅的卡车过桥。进行投资时，也是同样的道理。

最后，有些有商业头脑的人可能会怀疑，为什么我要写着篇文章。他们觉得，如果“价值型”的投资者人增加，股票的价格与价值之间的差异将会减少。我要告诉你们的是，自从50年前，Graham和Dodd的《Security Analysis》出版后，价值型投资早已不是什么秘密了。可是，在我自己运用它的这35年期间，没有迹象显示人们正转向价值投资法。这也许是人类的本性吧，人们总喜欢把简单的事情复杂化。在过去的这30多年，学术界的各种研究正是与价值型投资背道而驰的。我相信这种趋势还会继续下去。已经有船环绕了地球一周，但相信“地球是平的”的人却会越来越多。因此，市场上仍会出现价格与价值的巨大差异，而学习Graham & Dodd的人们将会继续从中受惠。
